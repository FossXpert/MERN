Tips for writing MD FILES
Here's a breakdown of how to write Markdown (md) files:

**1. Basic Formatting:**

- **Headings:** Use `#` symbols for main headings (e.g., `# This is a Main Heading`) and subsequent `#` for subheadings (e.g., ## This is a Subheading).
- **Paragraphs:** Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
- **Bold:** Wrap text in double asterisks (`**bold text**`) for bold formatting.
- **Italic:** Wrap text in underscores (`_italic text_`) for italics.
- **Strikethrough:** Wrap text in two tildes (`~~strikethrough text~~`).
- **Code:** Wrap inline code with backticks (`code example`). Use three backticks for code blocks:

```
This is a code block.
You can write multiple lines of code here.
```

**2. Lists:**

- Ordered lists: Use numbers followed by a period and a space (`. `) before each list item.
- Unordered lists: Use asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`) followed by a space before each item.

**3. Links:**

- Inline links: Use square brackets `[]` for link text and parentheses `()` for the URL and optional title:

  ```
  This is a link to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/ "The free encyclopedia").
  ```

- Reference links: Define a link with a label using curly braces `{}` at the bottom of the document, then reference the label in square brackets `[]` with the link text:

  ```
  Here's an example [reference link][1].

  ```

**4. Images:**

- Use an exclamation mark (`!`) followed by square brackets `[]` for the image description and parentheses `()` for the image path and optional title:

  ```
  ![Alt text for the image](path/to/image.jpg "Optional title")
  ```

**5. Tables:**

  Use pipes (`|`) to separate columns and hyphens (`-`) to create dividers:

  ```
  | Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
  |---|---|---|
  | Cell 1, row 1 | Cell 2, row 1 | Cell 3, row 1|
  | Cell 1, row 2 | Cell 2, row 2 | Cell 3, row 2 |
  ```

**6. Comments:**

  Add comments using HTML comments (``). These comments won't be displayed when the Markdown is rendered to HTML.

**Tips:**

- Use a Markdown editor for syntax highlighting and easier writing. Many text editors and online tools support Markdown.
- Preview your Markdown file often to see how it will look when rendered.
- Refer to the official Markdown Guide ([https://www.markdownguide.org/](https://www.markdownguide.org/)) for more details and advanced features.

By following these guidelines, you can create well-formatted and easy-to-read Markdown files.
