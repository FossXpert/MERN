1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them when the underlying data changes.

2. What are the key features of React?
- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components.
- Component-based architecture: React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build reusable UI components.
- One-way data flow: React follows a one-way data flow, making it easier to understand and debug the application's state changes.
- JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

3. What is the difference between functional components and class components in React?
Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return JSX elements. They are easier to write, test, and understand. Class components, on the other hand, are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have additional features like lifecycle methods and state.

4. What is the purpose of the virtual DOM in React?
The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to perform efficient updates and minimize the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM. When the state of a component changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the previous version and updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM.

5. What is JSX in React?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is used in React to define the structure and appearance of components. JSX gets transformed into JavaScript function calls that create React elements.

These are just a few examples of React interview questions. Remember to prepare for a wide range of topics, including component lifecycle, state management, React hooks, and performance optimization.
